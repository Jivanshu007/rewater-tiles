Initial tile which has a default owner (platform) and can be obtained by authorized players of the game.  💥By purchasing a tile, you become a full participant in the project.  👉 By owning a Tile, you can use Gravity, a force created by token staking, to make the owned Tile "heavier" and increase the Tile's ability to attract rain water. You increase the Gravity of your Tile by staking any cryptocurrency tokens into it. The heavier the Tile — the more water.
